# OBSTACLE-AVODING-ARDUINO-CAR-.
Obstacle Avoiding Arduino Car Model An obstacle-avoiding Arduino car is a smart robotic vehicle that detects obstacles in its path and automatically changes direction to avoid collisions. It is widely used as a beginner-level robotics project to understand sensors, motors, and microcontroller-based control systems.

Components Used 
• Ultrasonic Sensor: Used to measure the distance between the car and obstacles using ultrasonic waves. 
•Servo Motor: Rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan left and right directions. 
• Gear Motor: Provides sufficient torque to move the car wheels. 
• Jumper Wires: Used to make electrical connections between components. 
Working Principle The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance in front of the car. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the Arduino commands the servo motor to rotate the sensor and check distances on both sides. Based on the readings, the car moves in the direction with more free space using the gear motors. 

Applications 
• Autonomous robotic vehicles 
• Learning embedded systems and robotics 
• Smart navigation systems
